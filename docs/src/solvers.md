# Linear Systems
We provide several techniques for working with linear systems, including eigendecomposition using QR iteration and iterative solvers for linear systems. These solvers are useful for large, sparse systems where direct methods may be inefficient.

In addition, we provide functionality for solving linear programming problems.
