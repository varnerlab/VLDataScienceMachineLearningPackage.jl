# Cellular Automata
Cellular automata are discrete models studied in computational theory, mathematics, and theoretical biology. They consist of a grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, and evolve through simple rules based on the states of neighboring cells.

This is a fascinating area of study with applications in various fields, including physics, biology, and computer science. Here, we explore the Wolfram model of cellular automata, which provides a framework for understanding complex systems and emergent behavior.
